#### **Design Choices**
Days Gone Pies was designed to look clean, modern and attractive to the user.
It needed to accentuate the theme and content of the website without overpowering the
user visually.  I felt it needed to replcate the structure of a cake, be light, airy and tempt
the user into another helping.

*The following design choices were made with these decisions in mind:*

- [Clock](https://fontawesome.com/icons/clock?style=regular) | Recipe preparation / cooking Times
- [File - alt](https://fontawesome.com/icons/file-alt?style=regular) | Recipe description
- [List - ul](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-ul?style=solid) | Recipe ingredients
- [List - ol](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-ol?style=solid) | Recipe method
- [Username](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-tag?style=solid) | User registration / login
- [Password](https://fontawesome.com/icons/key?style=solid) | User password

#### **Colours**
The theme of the website needed to be light and airy, just like a cake sponge.
Pastel colours seemed to be the most logical approach and I decided that a
