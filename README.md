### **Design Choices**
Days Gone Pies was designed to look clean, modern and attractive to the user.
It needed to accentuate the theme and content of the website without overpowering the
user visually.  I felt it needed to replcate the structure of a cake, be light, airy and tempt
the user into another helping.

*The following design choices were made with these decisions in mind:*

#### **Fonts**
I selected my primary and secondary fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
For headers and button text, I used the ['Poppins'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text_type=custom#about) font, with the ['Open Sans'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text_type=custom)
font for the main body.  The two fonts complimented each other and kept the site looking clean and modern.
As the user will be following recipes and instructions, it was important to use a typeface that was easy on the eyes and could be clearly understood.

#### **Icons**
All of the icons used were generated by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Each icon was used in a situation where it applied to the content infront of the user,
providing a simpler user experience. By providing a visual aid to support the text content, the user would be more equiped to navigate the website efficently.

*The following icons were used:*
- [Book - open](https://fontawesome.com/icons/book-open?style=solid) | Recipe title
- [Folder - open](https://fontawesome.com/icons/folder-open?style=regular) | Recipe category
- [Chart - pie](https://fontawesome.com/icons/chart-pie?style=solid) | Recipe servings
- [Clock](https://fontawesome.com/icons/clock?style=regular) | Recipe preparation / cooking Times
- [File - alt](https://fontawesome.com/icons/file-alt?style=regular) | Recipe description
- [List - ul](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-ul?style=solid) | Recipe ingredients
- [List - ol](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-ol?style=solid) | Recipe method
- [Username](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-tag?style=solid) | User registration / login
- [Password](https://fontawesome.com/icons/key?style=solid) | User password

#### **Colors**
The theme of the website needed to be light and airy, just like a cake sponge.
Pastel colors seemed to be the most logical approach. I used [HTML Colorcodes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
to help choose the right shade.

To allow the user to read the content properly required a conforming text contrast.
Even though the test failed for smaller writing, I was happy to continue with the selection
as my headers and bolder text were greater in number and deemed an accepltable trade off.

For buttons and call to cation functions, I needed ensure the user could see that their
input was being accounted for. I used a black text on the same background to highligh the
change in cursor activity on the buttons. This passed with a higher success rate.

#### **Styling**
Styling the website was a simple task. Keep it tidy, keep it simple, keep it clean.
The design was very repetetive and gives the user the ability to learn the layout and functionsvery easily.
The wireframes will testify to this later and allowed me to adhere to the initial ideas in my concepts.
Each page is consistently repetetive and does not distract the user away from the content with too much verve.

#### **Backgrounds**
Initially, each page was going to have it's own background and theme according to content.
When putting this together it made the website feel like a different site for each page and considered this to be poor UX.
The background image on each page is now identical and gives a visual representation of what the site is about.

To improve UX and help the user identify their pathway quicker, I used specific images on each card to clearly define the category status.

#### **Bread** ![Bread](../DaysGonePie/static/images/recipe-categories/bread.png)

#### **Cake** ![Cake](../DaysGonePie/static/images/recipe-categories/cake.png)

#### **Dessert** ![Dessert](../DaysGonePie/static/images/recipe-categories/dessert.png)

#### **Pastry** ![Pastry](../DaysGonePie/static/images/recipe-categories/pastry.png)


These symbolise the core structure of the website, and help to guide the user down thier designated filepath. 
As the site gains more users and the database expands, more categories can be added and each new category will
follow the same structure and design principle.


#### **Card Images
As with the categories, each recipe card will aim to hold an image of what the finished recipe should look like
when complete.  At present, there are eight recipe images stored to show what
