### **Project Goals**
The purpose of Days Gone Pie is to create an attractive, functional, fullstack website for baking enthusiasts of all skill levels and abilities.

### **User Goals**
*Days Gone Pie is targeted at baking enthusiasts who want to:*
- Find new / specific recipes
- Learn new skills
- Share recipes with the community
- Review shared recipes

*Days Gone Pie is a great way to help users meet these needs by:*
- Providing access to a library of recipes for all ages and abilities
- Aid novice bakers in developing their skills by trying new recipes and techniques
- Giving the user the bility to share their recipes with the online community
-Review shared recipes to help inform other users

### **Developer Goals**
*As the developer of Days Gone Pie, the goal is to:*
- Exhibit a professional looking front end site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Design, develop and implement a back end application using Python
- Use Flask and MongoDB to create and manipulate Data
- Successfully deploy a full stack site to a cloud platform such as Heroku
- Prectise defensive design by identifying security features.

### **User Stories**
*As a user, interested in baking, I want:*
- The ability to search for and easily navigate to a recipes
- To know how many people the recipe serves and how long it will take to make
- To know if the recipe is suitable for people with allergies or special dietary requirements
- To know if the recipe is suitable for vegetarians or vegan friendly
- A clear list of ingredients I will need to make the recipe
- A structured step by step method of how prepare the recipe
- To look for handy tips that help me improve
- Advice on ingredients
- Create a user profile to manage my recipes
- To share my recipes with the community
- To be able to update or delete my recipes

### **Design Choices**
Days Gone Pies was designed to look clean, modern and attractive to the user.
It needed to accentuate the theme and content of the website without overpowering the
user visually.  I felt it needed to replcate the structure of a cake, be light, airy and tempt
the user into another helping.

*The following design choices were made with these decisions in mind:*

#### **Fonts**
I selected my primary and secondary fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
For headers and button text, I used the ['Poppins'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text_type=custom#about) font, with the ['Open Sans'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text_type=custom)
font for the main body.  The two fonts complimented each other and kept the site looking clean and modern.
As the user will be following recipes and instructions, it was important to use a typeface that was easy on the eyes and could be clearly understood.

#### **Icons**
All of the icons used were generated by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Each icon was used in a situation where it applied to the content infront of the user,
providing a simpler user experience. By providing a visual aid to support the text content, the user would be more equiped to navigate the website efficently.

*The following icons were used:*
- [Book - open](https://fontawesome.com/icons/book-open?style=solid) | Recipe title
- [Folder - open](https://fontawesome.com/icons/folder-open?style=regular) | Recipe category
- [Chart - pie](https://fontawesome.com/icons/chart-pie?style=solid) | Recipe servings
- [Clock](https://fontawesome.com/icons/clock?style=regular) | Recipe preparation / cooking Times
- [File - alt](https://fontawesome.com/icons/file-alt?style=regular) | Recipe description
- [List - ul](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-ul?style=solid) | Recipe ingredients
- [List - ol](https://fontawesome.com/icons/list-ol?style=solid) | Recipe method
- [Username](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-tag?style=solid) | User registration / login
- [Password](https://fontawesome.com/icons/key?style=solid) | User password

#### **Colors**
The theme of the website needed to be light and airy, just like a cake sponge.
Pastel colors seemed to be the most logical approach. I used [HTML Colorcodes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
to help choose the right shade.

![color](/static/readme.md/readme-images/color_picker.png)

To allow the user to read the content properly required a conforming text contrast.
Even though the test failed for smaller writing, I was happy to continue with the selection
as my headers and bolder text were greater in number and deemed an accepltable trade off.

![contrast](/static/readme.md/readme-images/contrast.png)


For buttons and call to cation functions, I needed ensure the user could see that their
input was being accounted for. I used a black text on the same background to highligh the
change in cursor activity on the buttons. This passed with a higher success rate.

![contrast_black](static/readme.md/readme-images/contrast_black.png)


#### **Styling**
Styling the website was a simple task. Keep it tidy, keep it simple, keep it clean.
The design was very repetetive and gives the user the ability to learn the layout and functionsvery easily.
The wireframes will testify to this later and allowed me to adhere to the initial ideas in my concepts.
Each page is consistently repetetive and does not distract the user away from the content with too much verve.
Using the wireframes as guidelines, the site developed organically and page layouts changed to reflect the changes.

#### **Backgrounds**
Initially, each page was going to have it's own background and theme according to content.
When putting this together it made the website feel like a different site for each page and considered this to be poor UX.
The background image on each page is now identical and gives a visual representation of what the site is about.

![jumbotron_hero_image](static/images/jumbotron/home.jpg)


To improve UX and help the user identify their pathway quicker, I used specific images on each card to clearly define the category status.

#### **Bread** ![Bread](/static/images/recipe-categories/bread.png)

#### **Cake** ![Cake](/static/images/recipe-categories/cake.png)

#### **Dessert** ![Dessert](/static/images/recipe-categories/dessert.png)

#### **Pastry** ![Pastry](/static/images/recipe-categories/pastry.png)


These symbolise the core structure of the website, and help to guide the user down thier designated filepath. 
As the site gains more users and the database expands, more categories can be added and each new category will
follow the same structure and design principle.


#### **Card Images**
As with the categories, each recipe card will aim to hold an image of what the finished recipe should look like
when complete.  At present, there are eight recipe images and these show the potential of the site, allowing the user 
to include an image of the recipe when adding content.


### **Wireframes**
The wireframes were build using [Just in Mind](https://www.justinmind.com/).
As mentioned in the styling section, the layout of the webite was designed with 
simplicity in mind.  I knew from the beginning that I wanted the design to be clean and efficient.
I knew that utilising a template would be the best way to approach the design and I could create the mockups
with little effort required.
I found the [Heroic-Features](https://startbootstrap.com/template/heroic-features) template on [Startbootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/)
and this gave me the building blocks to shape my design.

#### **Mobile First Design**

### **Features to Implement**
There are still features and functions of the site that I have yet to implement due to
various reasons such as time constraints, lack of understanding, or complexity.
At the time of submission, these are the features yet to be implemented.

- Custom 404 page to show the user if they have followed an incorrect filepath.
- Defensive programming when logging in, and for CRUD functionallity
- Improved edit function to allow ingredients and Method to be successfully altered
- Allow user to upload an image of their recipe
- Users can rate other users recipes

*NB - Some of these features were implemented but caused bug issues and were removed.
The write up can be found in the testing section of this document.*

and this includes all recipe images.
- Jumbotron image and recipe category image are credited to [Wallpaper Access](https://wallpaperaccess.com/)

### ***Code***
All code is my own unless credited within the application in comments.
I acknowledge that the code institute task manager mini project played a huge part in assembling this project. I have tried to use it as areference only and created my own code at every opportunity.

### ***Acknowledgemnts***
This has been a very difficult project due to current personal circumstances and is reflected in the final quality of the project.
While I am happy with the overall look of the project, there is still work to be done in the future to make it a better product and it is one that I would like to publish once I can do so.

I would like to thank several people, my family for their continued support, the amazing Stuart Crang who has consistently had my back throughout this difficult journey.
The tutor support who have been very helpful and supportive, especially over the last week when I have been hitting wall after wall. In particular, Scott Kipp who has been exceptional, and Michael who helped me get through a real stumbling block
and I stayed up through the night to recieve his support.
